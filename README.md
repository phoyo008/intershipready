Streamlit Water Quality Data App
This application provides an interactive visualization of water quality data. It allows users to explore datasets through dynamic charts and filters to gain insights into environmental trends.

Purpose
The goal of this project is to demonstrate full-stack Python literacy by building a data-driven web application. It uses Agile development techniques to manage the software lifecycle, from data processing to public deployment.

Features
Interactive Data Display: View raw data directly within the app.

Dynamic Visualizations: An interactive Plotly chart that updates based on user input.

User Controls: Sidebar widgets (such as dropdowns or sliders) to filter the dataset.

Agile Methodology: Developed using iterative cycles to ensure clear sections and user-focused design.

Dataset
The app uses a CSV dataset focused on water quality metrics, specifically the Biscayne Bay water quality data. The data includes parameters such as temperature, turbidity, and nutrient levels.
